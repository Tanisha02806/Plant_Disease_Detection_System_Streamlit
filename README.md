# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition System

An AI-powered **plant disease detection web application** built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow (Keras)**, and **FPDF**.
This system allows farmers, researchers, and agriculture enthusiasts to **upload or capture leaf images**, detect plant diseases using a trained CNN model, and **download detailed PDF reports**.
It also keeps a **prediction history** and includes a **feedback submission feature**.

## 📌 Features

* **AI Disease Detection** – Detects plant diseases from leaf images using a deep learning model.
* **Image Input Options** – Upload from your device or capture directly using your camera.
* **Detailed Disease Information** – Displays symptoms, causes, treatment, and prevention steps.
* **Instant PDF Reports** – Generates downloadable reports for offline use.
* **Prediction History** – Stores and retrieves past diagnoses with report downloads.
* **Excel Export** – Export your full history as an Excel file.
* **Feedback Submission** – Send feedback via Gmail directly from the app.
* **Custom UI Theme** – Modern green-themed responsive design.
