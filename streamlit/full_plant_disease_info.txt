-Fine webbing on the undersides of leaves, where mites congregate.
-Leaf bronzing, curling, and eventual drying or dropping in heavy infestations.
Cause:
Arthropod pest: Tetranychus urticae (Two-Spotted Spider Mite)
-Feeds on plant cell contents using needle-like mouthparts; reproduces rapidly under ideal conditions.
Prevention:
-Maintain Humidity and Reduce Dust: Spray water to increase humidity and reduce dust, which encourages mite buildup.
-Encourage Natural Predators: Promote or introduce beneficial insects like predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) and lady beetles.
Treatment:
-Miticide or Insecticidal Soap: Apply horticultural oil, insecticidal soap, or specific miticides like abamectin or bifenazate targeting mites.
-Physical Removal: In small gardens, hose down leaves with water to dislodge mites and remove heavily infested leaves.

Disease Name: Tomato___Target_Spot
Affected Crop: Tomato 
Typical Occurrence:
-Occurs in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in South and Central America, South Asia, and southern U.S.
-Typically affects crops during the flowering to fruiting stage, especially in dense or over-irrigated fields.
Conditions Favoring Disease:
-Warm, humid weather (25–30°C) with prolonged leaf wetness from rain, dew, or overhead irrigation.
-Poor air circulation and dense foliage, which trap moisture and promote fungal growth.
Symptoms:
-Brown circular spots with concentric rings (“target-like” appearance) on older leaves.
-Yellowing and premature drop of affected leaves, starting from the base of the plant.
-Lesions on stems and green fruit, sometimes leading to fruit rot.
Cause:
-Fungal pathogen: Corynespora cassiicola
-The fungus survives in infected plant debris and spreads via wind-blown spores and water splash.
Prevention:
-Crop Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris at the end of the season to reduce the inoculum.
-Proper Spacing & Irrigation: Ensure adequate plant spacing for air movement and avoid overhead irrigation.
Treatment:
-Fungicide Sprays: Apply protective fungicides such as chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin, or mancozeb at regular intervals during high-risk periods.
-Early Detection & Leaf Pruning: Regularly monitor plants and prune infected leaves to reduce disease spread and humidity in the canopy.

Disease Name: Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus
Affected Crop: Tomato 
Typical Occurrence:
-Found in tropical and subtropical regions including Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Americas.
-Common during warm seasons, especially in fields with heavy whitefly infestation.
Conditions Favoring Disease:
High whitefly populations (Bemisia tabaci) that transmit the virus during feeding.
-Warm temperatures (25–35°C) and dense planting that favor rapid vector reproduction and virus spread.
Symptoms:
-Upward curling and yellowing of young leaves, especially at the top of the plant.
-Stunted growth and shortened internodes, resulting in a bushy appearance.
-Reduced flowering and fruit set, causing significant yield losses.
Cause:
-Virus: Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a Begomovirus
-Transmitted by: Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), not by seed or mechanical means.
Prevention:
-Whitefly Control: Use yellow sticky traps, insect-proof nets, and reflective mulches to minimize whitefly activity.
-Use Virus-Resistant Varieties: Plant TYLCV-resistant or tolerant tomato cultivars whenever possible.
Treatment:
-Rogueing Infected Plants: Remove and destroy symptomatic plants early to limit virus reservoirs in the field.
-Systemic Insecticides: Apply systemic insecticides like imidacloprid or thiamethoxam to control whiteflies and interrupt virus spread (use responsibly to delay resistance).

Disease Name: Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus
Affected Crop: Tomato 
Typical Occurrence:
-Occurs worldwide, especially in areas with intensive tomato cultivation.
-Common in greenhouses and open fields, especially where sanitation is poor and tools/hands are shared between plants.
Conditions Favoring Disease:
-Frequent human handling, pruning, or grafting without proper sanitation (the virus is mechanically transmitted).
-Contaminated tools, seeds, or infected plant debris act as sources for virus spread.
Symptoms:
-Mottled light and dark green patches (mosaic) on leaves.
-Distorted or fern-like leaf growth, especially in young leaves.
-Stunted plants with poor fruit development, and sometimes internal browning of fruit flesh.
Cause:
-Virus: Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV), a stable and highly contagious mechanically transmitted virus.
-Not insect-vectored – spread occurs through infected tools, hands, and plant contact.
Prevention:
-Sanitation: Regularly disinfect hands and tools using bleach or alcohol during handling or pruning.
-Use Certified Virus-Free Seeds/Transplants:** Only plant ToMV-free seeds and resistant varieties.
Treatment:
-Rogueing: Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to reduce viral load and prevent spread.
-Soil and Surface Disinfection: Disinfect greenhouse benches, seed trays, and equipment with a strong disinfectant (e.g., 1% sodium hypochlorite).
